<title>Compiling software (which uses GiNaC) for Windows on Linux</title>

<a name="LinuxHostedCrossCompilation"></a>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Linux hosted <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> cross compiler.</li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://winehq.org">wine</a>, if you want to test your
builds (which is always a good idea).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Choosing the right version of cross compiler is very important. You should
install MinGW GCC version 3.4, GiNaC is known to not work with MinGW GCC 4.x.
You might want to try the binary packages for your favourite distribution
if they are based on the stable (3.4) version, however using
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/LinuxCrossMinGW"
	>the official release</a> is preferred.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> users, 
<b style="color: red">BEWARE!</b> Don't use the mingw32 package shipped 
in <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny">lenny</a>
(the latest stable release of Debian). That package is based on the experimental
version (4.2.2) of MinGW cross compiler and won't work with GiNaC (and most
likely it won't work with any C++ library which uses exceptions to inform
the user about error conditions). See e.g.
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=317146"
	>this bug report</a> for more details.

<h3>Preparations.</h3>

<h4> Unpack GiNaC binaries</h4>
Unpack the GiNaC <a href="./ginac-1.5.5-cln-1.3.1-gmp-4.3.1-i586-mingw32msvc.tar.bz2"
	>binary tarball</a> somewhere (for instance, in your home directory).
<p class="code">
cd <br />
tar xjf /path/to/ginac-VERSION-mingw32msvc.tar.bz2 <br />
</p>

<a name="WineSetupXCompile"></a>
<h4>Configure wine so it can use GiNaC DLL</h4>
In order to run the binaries (i.e. to test if they work at all) one need to
tell wine where to look for GiNaC DLL (and its dependencies). Unlike *NIX (in
particular, Linux, Solaris, *BSD's), Windows has no notion of <tt>rpath</tt>
or <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>. Instead it searches for dynamic libraries in
the current directory, the directory where application binary resides in,
and directories listed in the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable. Wine does
the same thing (well, almost), but there's one peculiarity. The <tt>PATH</tt>
environment variable used by wine has nothing to do with *NIX <tt>PATH</tt>.
Unlike all other environment variables <tt>PATH</tt> is <b>not</b> inherited
by wine from the parent process, instead wine reads it from the registry
(which is typically stored in the <tt>~/.wine/system.reg</tt> file).
So, one should add the <tt>$HOME/opt/i586-mingw32msvc/ginac/bin</tt> directory
to wine's <tt>PATH</tt>. To do that you can edit the <tt>~/.wine/system.reg</tt>
file with your favourite text editor (search for the "PATH" string), or use
the following script:
<p class="code">
cp -a ~/.wine/system.reg ~/.wine/system.reg.bak # make a copy if something goes wrong <br />
w_path="$(winepath -w $HOME/opt/i586-mingw32msvc/ginac/bin | sed -e 's/\\/\\\\\\\\/g')" <br />
sed -i -e "s/^\"PATH\"=\(.\+\)\"[ \t]*$/\"PATH\"=\1;${w_path}\"/g" ~/.wine/system.reg
</p>
Run the following command to check your setup
<p class="code">
wine ginsh.exe
</p>
The command above should start the GiNaC shell (<tt>ginsh</tt>) if your setup
is correct.

<a name="CrossCompileSimple"></a>
<h4>Cross-compiling a simple program</h4>
<p>
Run the following commands in order to compile a simple program <tt>simple.cpp</tt>:
<p class="code">
env GINAC_PREFIX="$HOME/opt/i586-mingw32msvc/ginac" \ <br />
<b>PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR="${GINAC_PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig"</b> \ # <b>(1)</b><br />
<b>PKG_CONFIG_PATH=""</b> \ # <b>(2)</b> <br />
i586-mingw32msvc-g++ -o simple.exe simple.cpp \ # <a href="#XCompilerNames">(3)</a> <br />
$(pkg-config --define-variable=prefix=${GINAC_PREFIX} --cflags --libs ginac) <br />
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Overrides the default path where <tt>pkg-config</tt> searches for
        <tt>*.pc</tt> files. This is necessary to prevent pkg-config from
	detecting native libraries. </li>
    <li>Tell <tt>pkg-config</tt> to NOT search for <tt>*.pc</tt> files in
        other directories. This is necessary to prevent pkg-config from
	detecting native libraries. </li>
    <li><a name="XCompilerNames"></a> Unfortunately the cross compiler
	binary is named differently in different distributions. It might
	be called <tt>i586-mingw32-g++</tt>, or <tt>i386-mingw32-g++</tt>,
	etc.
    </li>
</ol>

If you've configured wine as described in the 
<a href="#CrossCompilePrepare">previous paragraph</a> you can run the binary:
<p class="code">
wine simple.exe
</p>

<a name="CrossCompilePackage"></a>
<h4>Cross-compiling a package using GiNaC</h4>
Setting correct environment variables and giving proper command line options
is a bit involved
<p class="code">
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="" \ <br />
PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR="$HOME/opt/i586-mingw32msvc/ginac/lib/pkgconfig" \ <br />
CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc  \ # (<a href="#CrossCompilerNames2">1</a>) <br />
CXX=i586-mingw32msvc-g++ \ <br />
LD=i586-mingw32msvc-ld \   <br />
AS=i586-mingw32msvc-as \   <br />
LDFLAGS="-Wl,--enable-auto-import" \
	# (<a href="#LDFLAGS_explanation">2</a>) <br />
./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=$(uname -m)-linux-gnu \ 
	# (<a href="#XFlags_explanation">3</a>) <br />
	--prefix=$HOME/opt/i586-mingw32msvc/foo
</p>

After that one can (as usual)
<p class="code">
make <br />
make check <br />
make install <br />
</p>

<ol>

<li><a name="XCompilerNames2"></a>
Unfortunately the cross compiler binary is named differently in different
distributions. It might be called <tt>i586-mingw32-g++</tt>, or 
<tt>i386-mingw32-g++</tt>, etc. So you might need to adjust <tt>CC</tt>,
<tt>CXX</tt>, <tt>AS</tt>, and <tt>LD</tt> accordingly.
</li>

<li><a name="#LDFLAGS_explanation"></a>
Adding <tt>-Wl,--enable-auto-import</tt> to <tt>LDFLAGS</tt> is crucial,
otherwise the linker won't resolve references to any GiNaC (and CLN) methods
and/or functions.
</li>

<li><a name="#XFlags_explanation"></a>
If <tt>--build</tt> is not set explicitly the <tt>configure</tt> script
decides we are doing a native compilation (i.e. that we are compiling Windows
binaries on Windows), which makes the build fail. On the other hand, being
able to <b>directly</b> run Windows binaries is crucial for running tests.
Hence the need to explicitly set both <tt>--host</tt> <b>and</b>
<tt>--build</tt>.
